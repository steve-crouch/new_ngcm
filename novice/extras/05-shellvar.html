<p>The shell is just a program, and like other programs, it has variables. Those variables control its execution, so by changing their values you can change how the shell and other programs behave.</p>
<p>Let's start by running the command <code>set</code> and looking at some of the variables in a typical shell session:</p>
<pre><code>$ set</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub><sub><sub> COMPUTERNAME=TURING HOME=/home/vlad HOMEDRIVE=C: HOSTNAME=TURING HOSTTYPE=i686 NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4 OS=Windows_NT PATH=/Users/vlad/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin PWD=/home/vlad UID=1000 USERNAME=vlad ... </sub></sub></sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few—in fact, four or five times more than what's shown here. And yes, using <code>set</code> to <em>show</em> things might seem a little strange, even for Unix, but if you don't give it any arguments, it might as well show you things you <em>could</em> set.</p>
<p>Every variable has a name. By convention, variables that are always present are given upper-case names. All shell variables' values are strings, even those (like <code>UID</code>) that look like numbers. It's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary. For example, if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had, it would convert the value of the <code>NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</code> variable from a string to an integer.</p>
<p>Similarly, some variables (like <code>PATH</code>) store lists of values. In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator. If a program wants the individual elements of such a list, it's the program's responsibility to split the variable's string value into pieces.</p>
<h4 id="the-path-variable">The <code>PATH</code> Variable</h4>
<p>Let's have a closer look at that <code>PATH</code> variable. Its value defines the shell's <a href="../../gloss.html#search-path">search path</a>, i.e., the list of directories that the shell looks in for runnable programs when you type in a program name without specifying what directory it is in.</p>
<p>For example, when we type a command like <code>analyze</code>, the shell needs to decide whether to run <code>./analyze</code> or <code>/bin/analyze</code>. The rule it uses is simple: the shell checks each directory in the <code>PATH</code> variable in turn, looking for a program with the requested name in that directory. As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and runs the program.</p>
<p>To show how this works, here are the components of <code>PATH</code> listed one per line:</p>
<pre><code>/Users/vlad/bin
/usr/local/git/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>On our computer, there are actually three programs called <code>analyze</code> in three different directories: <code>/bin/analyze</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/analyze</code>, and <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code>. Since the shell searches the directories in the order they're listed in <code>PATH</code>, it finds <code>/bin/analyze</code> first and runs that. Notice that it will <em>never</em> find the program <code>/users/vlad/analyze</code> unless we type in the full path to the program, since the directory <code>/users/vlad</code> isn't in <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<h4 id="showing-the-value-of-a-variable">Showing the Value of a Variable</h4>
<p>Let's show the value of the variable <code>HOME</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo HOME</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub><sub><sub> HOME </sub></sub></sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>That just prints &quot;HOME&quot;, which isn't what we wanted (though it is what we actually asked for). Let's try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $HOME</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub><sub><sub> /home/vlad </sub></sub></sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>The dollar sign tells the shell that we want the <em>value</em> of the variable rather than its name. This works just like wildcards: the shell does the replacement <em>before</em> running the program we've asked for. Thanks to this expansion, what we actually run is <code>echo /home/vlad</code>, which displays the right thing.</p>
<h4 id="creating-and-changing-variables">Creating and Changing Variables</h4>
<p>Creating a variable is easy—we just assign a value to a name using &quot;=&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub><sub><sub> Dracula </sub></sub></sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>To change the value, just assign a new one:</p>
<pre><code>$ SECRET_IDENTITY=Camilla
$ echo $SECRET_IDENTITY</code></pre>
<p>{:class=&quot;in&quot;} <sub><sub><sub> Camilla </sub></sub></sub> {:class=&quot;out&quot;}</p>
<p>If we want to set some variables automatically every time we run a shell, we can put commands to do this in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in our home directory. (The '.' character at the front prevents <code>ls</code> from listing this file unless we specifically ask it to using <code>-a</code>: we normally don't want to worry about it. The &quot;rc&quot; at the end is an abbreviation for &quot;run control&quot;, which meant something really important decades ago, and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.)</p>
<p>For example, here are two lines in <code>/home/vlad/.bashrc</code>:</p>
<div class="file" markdown="1">
<pre><code>export SECRET_IDENTITY=Dracula
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup</code></pre>
</div>
<p>These three lines create the variables <code>SECRET_IDENTITY</code>, <code>TEMP_DIR</code>, and <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>, and export them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well. Notice that <code>BACKUP_DIR</code>'s definition relies on the value of <code>TEMP_DIR</code>, so that if we change where we put temporary files, our backups will be relocated automatically.</p>
<p>While we're here, it's also common to use the <code>alias</code> command to create shortcuts for things we frequently type. For example, we can define the alias <code>backup</code> to run <code>/bin/zback</code> with a specific set of arguments:</p>
<div class="file" markdown="1">
<pre><code>alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes. You can find interesting suggestions for other aliases and other bash tricks by searching for &quot;sample bashrc&quot; in your favorite search engine.</p>
